# DSH Plugins

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A pnpm workspace for independently versioned DeepSeek Harness plugins. Each plugin has its own manifest, source, tests, documentation, and installable package.

| Package | Directory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dsh-claude-ssh` | [packages/claude-ssh](packages/claude-ssh/README.md) | Use remote Claude Code over system OpenSSH in DSH |
| `dsh-usage-stats` | [packages/usage-stats](packages/usage-stats/README.md) | Track DSH and Claude SSH token usage with filters, grouped reports and CSV export |

## Setup

Requires Node.js ≥ 22.15.0 and pnpm **10.34.7**, pinned in `package.json`.

```sh
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm check
corepack pnpm pack:plugins
```

If pnpm is already available at the pinned version, use `pnpm` directly. The repository uses a single `pnpm-lock.yaml`; run dependency installation at the workspace root.

## Development

```sh
pnpm build          # Build every package
pnpm typecheck      # Type-check every package
pnpm test           # Run package tests
pnpm check          # Type-check, test, then build
pnpm test:ui        # Run available browser regression suites
pnpm pack:plugins   # Build and pack packages into dist/
```

Work on one plugin with a package filter:

```sh
pnpm --filter dsh-claude-ssh check
pnpm --filter dsh-claude-ssh test:ui
pnpm --filter dsh-claude-ssh pack:plugin
```

`test:ui` requires `agent-browser` and Chrome/Chromium. See the [plugin documentation](packages/claude-ssh/README.md#development-and-validation) for browser configuration.

## Installation

Install an individual built archive into the desired DSH profile:

```sh
pnpm pack:plugins
dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD/dist/dsh-claude-ssh-0.1.7.tgz"
```

For Desktop, fully quit DSH and use `--profile desktop`, then reopen the app. For Web, restart the updated profile and refresh the browser. Plugins are not currently published to npm. The repository root is a private workspace; install individual plugin archives rather than the GitHub root.

## Layout and new plugins

```text
packages/
  claude-ssh/           # dsh-claude-ssh: source, tests, manifest, docs
  usage-stats/          # DSH and Claude SSH usage statistics
scripts/
  build-client.mjs      # Shared DSH web client bundler
tsconfig.base.json     # Shared TypeScript compiler options
pnpm-workspace.yaml    # Discovers packages/*
pnpm-lock.yaml         # Workspace dependency lock
dist/                  # Generated installable archives (ignored)
```

Add each plugin under `packages/<plugin-name>` with a unique package name, its own version, and the standard `build`, `typecheck`, and `test` scripts. Root commands discover it automatically. Shared tools live at the root; plugin-specific dependencies belong to the plugin. Release plugins independently.

See [the development guide](docs/development.md) (Chinese) for manifests, client builds, packaging, and shared-code conventions.
